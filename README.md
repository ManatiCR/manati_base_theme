1. Stage your changes, ensuring they encompass exactly what you wish to change, no more.
2. Run the `commit` script via `yarn commit` or `npm run commit` and follow the prompts to craft the perfect commit message.
3. _Rejoice!_ For now your commit message will be used to create the changelog for the next version that includes that commit.
